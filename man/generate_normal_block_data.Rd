\usage{
generate_normal_block_data(
  n = 100,
  p = 40,
  d = 1,
  Q = 3,
  kappa = 0,
  omega_structure = "erdos-renyi",
  u_v = c(0.3, 0.1),
  SNR = 0.75,
  alpha = rep(1/Q, Q),

}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of individuals. Default to 100.}

\item{p}{number of variables. Default to 40.}

\item{d}{number of covariates. Default to 1.}

\item{Q}{number of groups. Default to 3.}

\item{kappa}{vector (or scalar) of variable-wise probability of zero inflation. Default to 0.}

\item{omega_structure}{the structure of the graph on which the precision matrix between groups is built. Can be a symmetric matrix with Q rows/columns or a character picked in "erdos-renyi", "preferential_attachment", "community" in which case a graph is drawn with sensible generation parameters. See generate_precision_matrix for details.}

\item{u_v}{two-size vector of positive numbers u and v controlling the generation of the precision matrix Omega: u is the off-diagonal elements of the precision matrix, controlling the magnitude of partial correlations with v a positive number being added to the diagonal elements of the precision matrix. The default value is c(0.3, 0.1).}

\item{SNR}{Signal to noise ratio: magnitude of the regression parameters B will be adjusted so that tr(var(XB)) and tr(Sigma) match the desried SNR.}

\item{alpha}{the Q-size vector of group proportion. Default to rep(1/Q, Q)}

\item{range_X}{A 2-size vector defining the range of the uniform distribution used to draw values in X, the regressor matrix. Default is c(0, 10)}

\item{range_D}{A 2-size vector defining the range of the uniform distribution used to draw values in D, the diagonal matrix of variances of variables. Default is c(0.5, 1.5)}
}
\value{
A named list with the following element
- Y a matrix of responses
- X a regressor/design matrix
- a list of model parameters, encompassing
   - B: matrix of regression coefficients
   - C: matrix of group membership
   - D: diagonal matrix of variance of the variables
   - Omega: precision matrix of the groups
   - Sigma: covariance matrix of the groups
   - kappa: vector of ZI inflation proabilities (one per variable)
}
\description{
A function to draw data from the normal block model (see details). The function returns both the generated data and the corrresponding model parameters, in a list.
