\title{Creates appropriate new normal block model depending on the parametrization}
\usage{
get_model(
  Y,
  X,
  blocks,
  sparsity = FALSE,
  zero_inflation = FALSE,
  noise_cov = c("diagonal", "spherical"),
  control = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{either a integer (number of blocks), a vector of integer (list of possible number of block)
or a p * Q matrix (for indicating block membership when its known)}

\item{sparsity}{boolean to say whether the model should be sparsified (several penalties tested)
OR float to run model with a single penalty value}

\item{zero_inflation}{boolean to indicate if Y is zero-inflated and adjust fitted model as a consequence}

\item{noise_cov}{character the type of covariance for the noise: either diagonal of spherical}

\item{control}{a list-like structure for detailed control on parameters should be
generated with normal_block_param() for collections of sparse models
