\arguments{
\item{niter}{number of iterations in model optimization}

\item{threshold}{loglikelihood / elbo threshold under which optimization stops}

\item{sparsity_weights}{weights with which the penalty should be applied in case
sparsity is required, non-0 values on the diagonal mean diagonal shall be
penalized too (default is non-penalized diagonal and 1s off-diagonal)}

\item{sparsity_penalties}{list of penalties the user wants to test, other parameters
are only used if penalties is not specified}

\item{n_sparsity_penalties}{number of penalties to test.}

\item{min_ratio}{ratio for sparsity between max penalty (0 edge penalty) and min penalty to test}

\item{fixed_tau}{whether tau should be fixed at clustering_init during optimization
useful for calls to fixed_Q models in stability_selection}

\item{clustering_init}{proposal of initial value for clustering, when Q is
unknown, can be a list with one clustering for each Q value}

\item{verbose}{telling if information should be printed during optimization}

\item{heuristic}{weather to use heuristic approach or not. Default is FALSE}

\item{noise_covariance}{variance can be variable specific ("diagonal", the default) or common ("spherical")}

\item{clustering_approx}{to use for clustering with heuristic inference method}
