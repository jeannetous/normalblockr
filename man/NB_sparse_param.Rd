\usage{
NB_sparse_param(
  sparsity_weights = NULL,
  penalties = NULL,
  n_penalties = 30,
  min_ratio = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sparsity_weights}{weights with which penalty should be applied in case
sparsity is required, non-0 values on the diagonal mean diagonal shall be
penalized too (default is non-penalized diagonal and 1s off-diagonal)}

\item{penalties}{list of penalties the user wants to test, other parameters
are only used if penalties is not specified}

\item{n_penalties}{number of penalties to test.}

\item{min_ratio}{ratio between max penalty (0 edge penalty) and min penalty to test
Generates control parameters for the NB_fixed_blocks_sparse class}
