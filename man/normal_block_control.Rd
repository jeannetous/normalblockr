\usage{
normal_block_control(
  sparsity_weights = NULL,
  penalties = NULL,
  n_penalties = 30,
  min_ratio = 0.01,
  fixed_tau = FALSE,
  clustering_init = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sparsity_weights}{weights with which penalty should be applied in case
sparsity is required, non-0 values on the diagonal mean diagonal shall be
penalized too (default is non-penalized diagonal and 1s off-diagonal)}

\item{penalties}{list of penalties the user wants to test, other parameters
are only used if penalties is not specified}

\item{n_penalties}{number of penalties to test.}

\item{min_ratio}{ratio between max penalty (0 edge penalty) and min penalty to test}

\item{fixed_tau}{whether tau should be fixed at clustering_init during optimization
useful for calls to fixed_Q models in stability_selection}

\item{clustering_init}{proposal of initial value for clustering, when Q is
unknown, can be a list with one clustering for each Q value}

\item{verbose}{telling if information should be printed during optimization}
