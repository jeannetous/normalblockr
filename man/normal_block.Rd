\usage{
normal_block(
  Y,
  X,
  nb_blocks = NULL,
  blocks = NULL,
  sparsity = 0,
  zero_inflation = FALSE,
  niter = 100,

}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{observations data, n observations of p categories, dim n*p.}

\item{X}{covariates data, n observations of d covariates, dim n*d.}

\item{nb_blocks}{number of blocks (if fixed) or list of possible number of blocks otherwise}

\item{sparsity}{sparsity factor to apply to blocks covariance matrix (or possibly list of such values with same length as nb_blocks)}

\item{zero_inflation}{boolean to indicate if Y is zero-inflated and adjust fitted model as a consequence}

\item{niter}{number of iterations in model optimization}

\item{threshold}{loglikelihood / elbo threshold under which optimization stops}

\item{C}{blocks, if known, under the form of a p * Q matrix}
}
\value{
an R6 object with class [`NB`] or [`NB_unknown`] or [`NB_unknown_ZI`]
}
\description{
